# MuffaloBot

This is the source code for a bot hosted on the RimWorld Discord. 



## How to self-host

Open the project using Visual Studio. Create a new resources file under the `MuffaloBotNetStandard` project called `AuthResourcesCreateNewIfDownloadingFromRepo.resx`. 

Fill in the following fields:
`BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot's token
`STEAM_APIKEY`: The API key for interfacing with the [Steam API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

Compile the solution as usual.

MuffaloBotNetFramework targets the .NET Framework, MuffaloBotNetCore targets .NET Core.
